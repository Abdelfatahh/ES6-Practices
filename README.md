# ES6 Practices

## Module 1- var, let and const. 

* var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.

* var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope;
let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.

* They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while varvariables are initialized with undefined,
let and const variables are not initialized.

* While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.

## Conclusion ##

1. Use "const" normally for variable declaration.

2. Use let only if rebinding is needed. 

3. Never use var.
